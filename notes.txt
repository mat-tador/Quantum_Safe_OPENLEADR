-> openssl version 

- hyperfine -> sudo apt install hyperfine >= 1.18  

VERIFYING INSTALLATION OF HYPERFINE 
-> hyperfine --version 
- kyber -> git clone https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber.git

kyber has two folders 
ref/ 
avx2/
that must be complide using make and then run one of the following test 
test/test_kyber$ALG
test/test_vectors$ALG
test/test_speed$ALG

It is possible to test either with the test_speed, but that will results only in the cycles/ticks for each formulation or running 
-> hyperfine test/test_kyber512 -r 50
